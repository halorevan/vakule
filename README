Vakule is going to be a freeform game based around one person, the player, who
goes about doing things.  And gets things done.

Yeah.  No idea.


Here's the general plan:

There exists a player created in the character creation.  From there, you
choose attributes, skills, and other things based on character points as well
as one personality trait that changes the dialogue, reactions, and other things
within the game.  Overall, the travelling system will be a lot like Fallout 1
and Fallout 2, dialogue from Mass Effect, and character management like
something.  In addition, followers and grunts will be added in to help the
player, since those who stray alone usually die alone.

The setting is realism-inclined futuristic sci-fi where humans have colonized
on a planet.  However, political turmoil erupts and essentially makes a
stateless society.

This is all under the GPL license, or maybe BSD* license.

If you want to submit work to this project right now, please specify the
licenses you want to release the code under, if you have a specific preference.
Code added to a project will be removed if the license ultimately chosen would
be incompatible with the license desired, and you will be notified of this.
